# WebviewRuby

WebViewRuby is a library that provide bindings for [webview/webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) a tiny tiny cross-platform webview library to build modern cross-platform GUIs. Webview uses Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, gtk-webkit2 on Linux and Edge on Windows 10.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'webview_ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install webview_ruby

## Usage

### Hello World

Create a new Webview instance 

```ruby
webview = WebviewRuby::Webview.new
```

Set the size and the title of the window

```ruby
webview.set_title("Example")
webview.set_size(480, 360)
```

Navigate to a specific webpage

```ruby
webview.navigate("https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page")
```

Then run the main loop till its terminated (remember to always destroy the webview after it stops running)

```ruby
webview.run
webview.destroy
```

### Run ruby code from JS

You can bind a ruby function to a JavaScript one before the webview is in running state. To do so use the `bind` method like:

```ruby
webview.bind("exampleFunc") do
  print("got called by js")
end
```

Now you can use `exampleFunc` as any other JS function, you can call it from the javascript that has been loaded in the webview or
from the html. If you want to make a function take some parameters, just add parameters to the `do` block like so: 

```ruby
webview.bind("exampleFunc") do |arg1, arg2|
  print("got called by js with #{arg1} and #{arg2}")
end
```

You can only use positional arguments, keyword ones wouldn't work.

### Run JS code from ruby

You can invoke JS code to be run asynchrounously (the result of the execution won't be returned to you) by running

```ruby
webview.eval("console.log('Called from ruby')")
```

### Terminate the main loop

```
webview.terminate
```

### Run JS code at initialisation

If you want to inject JavaScript code at the initialization of the new page, such that every time the webview will open a the new page - this initialization code will be executed, then you can use

```ruby
webview.init("console.log('running at initialisation')")
```

It is guaranteed that code is executed before window.onload.
